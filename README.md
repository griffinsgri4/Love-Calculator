## Description

The Love Calculator is a fun, light-hearted program designed to determine the compatibility between two people based on their names. It combines the letters from both names, counts specific letters, and computes a score to predict the relationship's potential.

## Installation
## Installation

To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/griffinsgri4/love-calculator.git
    cd love-calculator
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python love_calculator.py
    
    ```
    example:
       Welcome to the Love Calculator!
What is your name? 
Alice
What is their name? 
Bob
Your score is 38, you are alright together.

In this example:

The user entered "Alice" as their name and "Bob" as the other person's name.
The script calculated a love score of 38 based on the occurrence of certain letters in the combined string of the names.
Since the score falls between 40 and 50, the message "Your score is 38, you are alright together." is displayed.

4. Follow the prompts to enter the names and see the love score.
